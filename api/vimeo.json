Kae repurposes materials sourced online and pairs them with images from his personal archive in an effort to wade through the deep emotions surrounding his father's death and the sudden relocation of his children, collapsing time and memory in the process. Taking the autobiographical model as his point of departure, Kae explores how an intimate account of one\u2019s life can potentially extend beyond the realm of personal experiences. In 2020, I ran from it and was still in it screened at the Locarno Film Festival where it won the prestigious Golden Leopard for Best International Short Film and, in 2021, the film was awarded Special Jury Recognition for Poetry in the Documentary Shorts category at the 2021 SXSW Film Festival.","url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/429057909","upload_date":"2020-06-14 15:34:42","thumbnail_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1055611258_100x75.webp","thumbnail_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1055611258_200x150.webp","thumbnail_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1055611258_640.webp","user_id":99228233,"user_name":"Darol Olu Kae","user_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user99228233","user_portrait_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38483442_30x30.webp","user_portrait_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38483442_75x75.webp","user_portrait_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38483442_100x100.webp","user_portrait_huge":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38483442_300x300.webp","stats_number_of_likes":85,"stats_number_of_plays":4643,"stats_number_of_comments":10,"duration":644,"width":1920,"height":1080,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":540630979,"title":"Motherland","description":"","url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/540630979","upload_date":"2021-04-23 08:21:56","thumbnail_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1119114035_100x75.webp","thumbnail_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1119114035_200x150.webp","thumbnail_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/1119114035_640.webp","user_id":36321460,"user_name":"Ellen Evans","user_url":"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user36321460","user_portrait_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38585447_30x30.webp","user_portrait_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38585447_75x75.webp","user_portrait_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38585447_100x100.webp","user_portrait_huge":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/38585447_300x300.webp","stats_number_of_likes":96,"stats_number_of_plays":4893,"stats_number_of_comments":6,"duration":794,"width":1920,"height":1080,"tags":"","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":439430168,"title":"Friday","description":"Directed by: Aisha Amin<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFRIDAY is a short documentary about the community within a historically black Brooklyn mosque that is fighting against gentrification in New York City.
